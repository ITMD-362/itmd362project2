# Self - critique

This project was fun and challenging at the same time. Pull/merge/accept commits from each team member was something new we learned. What I leaned was, exciting everything from CSS to JavaScript and html5. I learned how to work with different colors schemes. There were many things we did and the ideas that were used were really new and fresh. Redesigning the website was really cool, hopefully in the future I can redesign some other website. Iâ€™m really interested in web development, to be specific front end web development.
